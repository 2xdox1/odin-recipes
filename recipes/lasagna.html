    <h2> Description </h2>
    <h3> Preparation of Ingredients </h3>
    <p> To make a delicious lasagna, begin by gathering the necessary ingredients. You will need lasagna noodles, ground beef or Italian sausage, ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, tomato sauce, garlic, onions, and a blend of Italian herbs. Boil the lasagna noodles until they are al dente, ensuring they are not overly soft. Meanwhile, brown the ground meat in a skillet with finely chopped onions and garlic. Combine the tomato sauce with the meat, and season the mixture with the Italian herbs. Assemble the cheeses separately, ready for layering. </p>
    <h3> Layering and Baking </h3>
    <p> To assemble the lasagna, start by spreading a thin layer of the meat sauce at the bottom of a baking dish. Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top, followed by a generous spread of ricotta cheese and a sprinkle of mozzarella and Parmesan. Repeat the process until you have multiple layers, finishing with a top layer of meat sauce and a final layer of cheeses. Preheat the oven to the recommended temperature, cover the baking dish with foil, and bake until the lasagna is bubbling and the cheese is melted and golden brown. Allow it to rest for a few minutes after removing it from the oven before serving. </p>
    <h3> Serving and Enjoying </h3>
    <p> Once the lasagna has rested, slice it into portions and serve each piece on a plate. Garnish with fresh basil or parsley for a burst of color and additional flavor. Pair the lasagna with a side salad or garlic bread to complete the meal. Whether preparing it for a family dinner or a special occasion, homemade lasagna provides a hearty and satisfying dish that is sure to be enjoyed by all. Adjust the ingredients and proportions to suit personal preferences, creating a customized lasagna that becomes a favorite in your culinary repertoire. </p>
